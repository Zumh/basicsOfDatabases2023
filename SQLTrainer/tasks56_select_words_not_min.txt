Search all words except alphabetically first. You can assume that no two words are the same in the table.

SELECT sana FROM Sanat WHERE sana NOT IN (SELECT MIN(sana) FROM Sanat);
SELECT sana FROM Sanat ORDER BY sana LIMIT (SELECT COUNT(*)-1 FROM Sanat) OFFSET 1;

SELECT word FROM Words WHERE word NOT IN (SELECT MIN(word) FROM Words);
SELECT word FROM Words ORDER BY word LIMIT (SELECT COUNT(*) - 1 FROM Words) OFFSET 1;
